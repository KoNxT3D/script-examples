Linux Ping And Traceroute Examples

These are two basic ping and traceroute bash scripts, one of which
is a manually entered host name the other is menu based.

preset.sh is the menu based bash script and comes with
default host names.
With variable.sh, just enter a domain name; ie google.com.
variable.sh outputs to a text file, preset.sh does not.
